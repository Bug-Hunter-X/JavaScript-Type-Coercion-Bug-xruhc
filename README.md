# JavaScript Type Coercion Bug
This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion.  The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's loose typing, adding a number and a string results in string concatenation.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution using explicit type checking.

This is a simple example, but highlights a critical issue in JavaScript that can lead to unexpected behavior in more complex applications.
